  "readme": "# binpack\n\n_Minimalist numeric binary packing utilities for node.js_\n\n## What's all this?\n\nThis is an intentionally simple binary packing/unpacking package for node.js for programmers who prefer to write most of their parsing code in javascript.  This exposes some common binary formats for numbers.\n\nsee the included COPYING file for licensing.\n\nthe core of the module is the set of `pack`/`unpack` pair functions.  The meaning should be clear from the name - for example, `packInt32` packs a given javascript number into a 32-bit int inside a 4-byte node.js Buffer, while `unpackFloat32` unpacks a 4-byte node.js Buffer containing a native floating point number into a javascript number.\n\nThe following types are available for both pack and unpack:\n\n    Float32 \n    Float64 \n    Int8\n    Int16 \n    Int32\n    Int64\n    UInt8 \n    UInt16\n    UInt32\n    UInt64\n    \nEach `pack*` function takes a javascript number and outputs a node.js Buffer.\n\nEach `unpack*` function takes a node.js Buffer and outputs a javascript number.\n\nBoth types of functions take an optional second argument.  If this argument is `\"big\"`, the output is put in big endian format.  If the argument is `\"little\"`, the output is put in little endian format.  If the argument is anything else or non-existent, we default to your machine's native encoding.\n\n## How is this different than the `binary` module on npm?\n\nIt contains floating point values, and it has packing functions",
